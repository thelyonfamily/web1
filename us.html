   <h2>Start-up</h2>
   <p>We started out of our home office knowing little but after a few coding classes we
     eventually got the hang of HTML5 and CSS.</p>
 <h2>History</h2>
 <p>Locally started out by going to coding classes and thought
   it would be interesting to try to build our own website using what we had learned.
   Based out of Minnesota we coded all of this in our home office.</p>
   <h2>Future Plans</h2>
   <p>There is a lot planned for the future of this website including
     making changes often to get a good learning experience from and for future
     web pages.</p>
